### Hi there 👋

I'm Caio Davi, an undergraduate student in Computer Science at Universidade Federal de Campina Grande and tutor for elementary and middle school students.  
🔭 I'm currently learning about web development, with React and JS.  
🌱 I'm a member of PETCOMP.  
💬 I have some simple projects that I do to learning about such languages.  
:information_desk_person: I am passionate about listening to music (any style), e-games, basketball, football and running. My hobbies are related to all these things.
